\begin{abstract}
Adaptive behavior requires the flexible use of information based on learned contingencies in the environment. In rodents, the medial frontal cortex (MFC) may function importantly in this process---in part, by representing information related to choices, outcomes, and the context in which decisions are made. However, we lack a detailed understanding of how cortical microcircuits process information during context-dependent behavior. One important basic question regards how this labor is divided between different cell types of the neocortex. We used two-photon calcium imaging during a rule-switching task to separately examine the contributions of PV-, SST-, and VIP-expressing inhibitory neurons, as well as pyramidal excitatory neurons, to the representation of information required for flexible sensorimotor behavior. All four cell types were significantly modulated by choices and their outcomes, as well as the rules dictating which sensorimotor mappings would lead to a reward.

%Recent studies have focused on the question of how this labor is divided between non-overlapping cell types of the neocortex, such PV-, SST-, and VIP-expressing inhibitory neurons, as well as pyramidal excitatory neurons. Determining how distinct cell types in MFC are modulated by task variables would contribute importantly to our understanding of how MFC processes task-related information. In general, studies have emphasized differences, eg,... distinct behavioral correlates associated with the activity of different cell types.

%In the present study, we examine the contributions of PV, SST, VIP, and PYR neurons in MFC to the representation of information required for flexible sensorimotor behavior.

%We used two-photon calcium imaging to explore whether neural representations during a rule-switching task exhibit cell-type specificity.

% One important basic question regards how this labor is divided between different cell types of the neocortex, such PV-, SST-, and VIP-expressing inhibitory neurons, as well as pyramidal excitatory neurons. In the present study, we examine the contributions of these four non-overlapping, genetically defined cell types to task-related neural representations in MFC.
